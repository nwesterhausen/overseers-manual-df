 * The creature will retract into the specified body part(s) when threatened. It will be unable to move or attack, but enemies will only be able to attack the specified body part(s). When one of the specified body part is severed off, the creature automatically unretracts and cannot retract anymore. More than one body part can be selected by using `BY_TYPE` or `BY_CATEGORY`.
 * 
 * Second-person descriptions are used for adventurer mode natural ability. `"<pro_pos>"` can be used in the descriptions, being replaced with the proper pronoun (or lack thereof) in-game.
 * 
 * Undead curled up creatures are buggy, specifically those that retract into their upper bodies: echidnas, hedgehogs and pangolins. The upper body is prevented from collapsing by a separate body part (the middle spine), which cannot be attacked when the creature is retracted. See `[PREVENTS_PARENT_COLLAPSE]`. Living creatures eventually succumb to blood loss, but undead creatures do not. Giant creatures also take a very long time to bleed out.

 * # Parsing Options
 * 
 * Specify what to parse and where to parse it from.
 * 
 * ## Parsing `info.txt` vs the raw files
 * 
 * There are two main parsing functions: `parse` and `parse_module_info_files`.
 * 
 * Both use the same options struct, but they use it in different ways.
 * 
 * When calling `parse`, the `ParserOptions` struct is used to specify what raws to parse and where to parse them from.
 * Any specified `raw_modules_to_parse` will not be parsed in the `parse` function, and the only items parsed in the
 * `parse_module_info_files` function are the `module_info_files_to_parse`.
 * 
 * ## Example
 * 
 * ```rust
 * use std::path::PathBuf;
 * use dfraw_parser::metadata::{ParserOptions, ObjectType, RawModuleLocation};
 * use dfraw_parser::traits::RawObject;
 * 
 * let mut options = ParserOptions::new();
 * options.add_location_to_parse(RawModuleLocation::Vanilla);
 * // Clear the default object types
 * options.set_object_types_to_parse(vec![]);
 * // Add back in the ones we want
 * options.add_object_type_to_parse(ObjectType::Creature);
 * options.add_object_type_to_parse(ObjectType::CreatureVariation);
 * // Include the metadata with the parsed raws
 * options.attach_metadata_to_raws();
 * 
 * // Then you could parse the raws and info.txt files
 * // let parsed_raws = dfraw_parser::parse(&options);
 * ```
 *
